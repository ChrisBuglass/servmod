			<p>Jake is a Retirement Pension claimant who has experienced difficulties with remembering things and making routine decisions recently.</p>
			<p>Jake and his son Paul attend a doctor’s appointment, where they learn that Jake’s symptoms are associated with dementia, and that they are likely to deterioriate further.</p>
			<p>The doctor provides Jake and Paul with information about what to do next, and where they can find further support. Paul intends to fund his father's care himself.</p>
