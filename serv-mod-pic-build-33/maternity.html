              <p>When people forget to tell the DWP about a change, we can rely on information from our suppliers such as HMRC to fill in the gaps. We'll know when people are working whilst claiming Maternity Allowance. We can use this information to suppress any further payment, which protects citizens from being overpaid benefit.</p>
