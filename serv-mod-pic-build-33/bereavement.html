			<p> Dave and Anne are a couple who have a joint claim to Universal Credit which topped up the income they made at their respective jobs. Anne also received PIP. Unfortunately, Anne has recently passed away.</p>
			<p>Dave is worried about how he will pay for the funeral, food and bills. He is also concerned about what will happen to his future benefit payments.</p>

			<p>Dave searches online to find out what to do if someone dies and finds the GOV.UK step by step guide that tells him how to register the death online.</p>
			
			<p>Dave provides some additional information about his partner so that the Government can handle related affairs, including his Universal Credit, council tax, driving license, etc.</p>

				  <p>Because Dave registered the death online it means that he doesn't have to do everything himself. The DWP, along with other relevant departments such as HMRC, DVLA and others will be automatically notified of the bereavement. When the DWP receive this information we can update Dave and Anne's different claims to benefit immediately.</p>
			  </div>

		  <p>Universal Credit amend the joint claim to reflect this change, while PIP simultaneously cease any further payment preventing the risk of overpayment.</p>

			<p>At the end of the death registration journey, Dave is signposted to information about benefits for bereaved citizens which he would be entitled to.

				  <p>Payments are faster, safer, and more transparent for citizens. With payment industry reform on the horizon the DWP can build towards a more flexible payment system that has a universal approach to paying all claimants.</p>

			<p>Later, Dave is notified to say that his Universal Credit joint claim has been converted into a single claim. Dave is made aware of how his payments have been adjusted to reflect this, as well as what he can expect to receive based on his overall household income.</p>

	  <p>To deliver accelerated decisions our components and services work together. Joined up and trusted data enables us to simplify processing claimant information across the department without the need for manual intervention or excessive customer contact. This makes it simpler for the citizen to interact with the Government as a whole, and removes barriers that have slowed us down in the past. </p>
